\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
$<$Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this 
document, including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the 
product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only 
part of the system or a single subsystem.$>$

\section{Document Conventions}
$<$Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when 
writing this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance.  
For example, state whether priorities  for higher-level requirements are assumed 
to be inherited by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement 
is to have its own priority.$>$

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
$<$Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, 
such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and 
documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is 
organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the 
overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to 
each reader type.$>$

\section{Project Scope}
$<$Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, 
including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to 
corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document 
is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.$>$

\section{References}
$<$List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may 
include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements 
specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide 
enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, 
including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.$>$


\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
$<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.  
For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product 
family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained 
product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the 
requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and 
identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major 
components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external 
interfaces can be helpful.$>$

\section{Product Functions}
$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user 
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary 
(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of 
related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram 
or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
$<$Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product.  
User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product 
functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational 
level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.  
Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the 
most important user classes for this product from those who are less important 
to satisfy.$>$

\section{Operating Environment}
$<$Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the 
hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software 
components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.$>$

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
$<$Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the 
developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware 
limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other 
applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel 
operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security 
considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the 
customer’s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered 
software).$>$

\section{User Documentation}
$<$List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, 
and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any 
known user documentation delivery formats or standards.$>$
\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

$<$List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the 
requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial 
components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating 
environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions 
are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the 
project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to 
reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for 
example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
$<$Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software 
product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards 
or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout 
constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on 
every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on.  
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of 
the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface 
specification.$>$

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
$<$Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between 
the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include 
the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions 
between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be 
used.$>$

\section{Software Interfaces}
$<$Describe the connections between this product and other specific software 
components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, 
libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or 
messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each.  
Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to 
documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols.  
Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data 
sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a 
global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an 
implementation constraint.$>$

\section{Communications Interfaces}
$<$Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions 
required by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network server 
communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent 
message formatting. Identify any communication standards that will be used, such 
as FTP or HTTP. Specify any communication security or encryption issues, data 
transfer rates, and synchronization mechanisms.$>$

\chapter{System Features}
$<$This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the 
product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may 
prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, 
object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the 
most logical sense for your product.$>$


% HARDWARE FEATURES
\section{Hardware features}

\subsection{Description and Priority}
%{Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of 
%High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority 
%component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a 
%relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).

Mentioned in this chapter features are related to the lowest layer of supercomputer, which in short describes of what components should be managed by a system. Features of this type have a really high priority, because they determine the supercomputer as a whole. Mentioned requirements stands for a hearth of a supercomputer and system. Glossary for this feature is in appendix \ref{app:glossary:hardware}.

%\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
%$<$List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the 
%behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements 
%associated with use cases.$>$

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
%$<$Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature.  
%These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user 
%to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case.  
%Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or 
%invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, 
%verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary 
%information is not yet available.$>$

%$<$Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a 
%meaningful tag of some kind.$>$

% USER FEATURES
\section{User features}

\subsection{Description and Priority}
%{Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of 
%High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority 
%component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a 
%relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).
Mentioned in this chapter requirements are related to the users in a supercomputer system. System distinguish some type of users, which are differently accounted. Each of users can have different permissions. Users can be connected and gathered in a groups, which can have a permissions. 
Glossary for this feature is in appendix \ref{app:glossary:user}.

\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
%$<$List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the 
%behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements 
%associated with use cases.$>$
Requirements in this chapter are related to the structure of users using supercomputer. Some of requirements were extracted from the customer demands, but the other part had to be found during requirement analysis.
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
%$<$Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature.  
%These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user 
%to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case.  
%Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or 
%invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, 
%verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary 
%information is not yet available.$>$

%$<$Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a 
%meaningful tag of some kind.$>$
Subsections below are a list of a requirements related to the hardware feature.
Requirements extracted from user demands:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-1} -- Each researcher is grouped according to department structure. Should be in a group.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-2} -- Each researcher group has different permissions connected with available resources in a system (Has a limit on resources).
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-3} -- particular researcher can have a grant, which gives more resources to usage (Gives additional permissions).
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-4} -- Students are grouped by enrolled programs. Student has to be in a group.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-5} -- Each student has a cp on maximum usable resources. Both cumulative and instantaneous, which may depend on their group. Look at requirements \textbf{USR-6} and \textbf{USR-7}.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-6} -- Instantaneous cap is correlated with student groups. It describes how many processors, nodes student can use at once (single use).
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-7} -- Cumulative cap is correlated with a student group. It gives an information about cumulative usage of a supercomputer in range of dates, for example student can only use machine for $8h$ monthly.
	}
\end{itemize}

	Allocation of resource for research groups should be understood as continuous access to some amount of processors and storage in the system. Resources are shared between group, which means that if one of the researchers uses all resources, no on of the rest can use it in the same time. A difference between student and research group is that: firstly allocation of resources and secondly restrictions, caps and limits. The common parts are instantaneous limits, i.e. limits of processors per usage.
	
Requirement extracted during analysis:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-1} -- Only IT supporter should be able to manage structure of users in a system.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-2} -- IT supporter should be able to create a research group.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-3} -- IT supporter should be able to modify a research group.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-4} -- IT supporter should be able to delete a research group.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-5} -- It supporter should be able to add permissions to a research group.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-6} -- IT supporter should be able to add allocation of resources to a research group.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-7} -- IT supporter should be able to add users to a research group.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-8} -- IT supporter should be able to add user to a system.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-9} -- IT supporter should be able to modify user permissions (grants).
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-10} -- IT supporter should be able to create student group.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-11} -- IT supporter should be able to add permissions to a student group.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-12} -- IT supporter should be able to add restrictions (caps) to a student group.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-13} -- IT supporter should be able to add members to a student group.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-14} -- IT supporter should be able to remove members from a student group.
	}
	\item
	{
		\textbf{USR-A-15} -- IT supporter should be able to remove members from a research group.
	}
\end{itemize}
	During the analysis found a incoherence about the amount of resources in the system connected to the single user. In consequences assumption were made as follows: if user is in a multiple groups (in terms of research of student groups) his account balance is added, in other words user would be able to use all permissions and all balances from all groups that he belongs into. Restrictions to the users are based on the student group only so, if user belongs to multiple groups the restriction is applied only in terms of a group that he use for submitting the job to the system.
