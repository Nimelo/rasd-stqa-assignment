\chapter{Hardware requirements} \label{sec:hardware_requirements}
	Mentioned in this chapter requirements are for job controller which should be able to handle with hardware in the most optimal way.
	
	\section{Demands of customer}
	\label{sec:hardware_requirements_demands}
		The system is heterogeneous system containing:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A set of "traditional" computing nodes, i.e. shared-memory multi-core CPUs;
			\item A set of "accelerated" computing node, same as above  but with 1 or 2 attached GPUs dedicated to computations;
			\item A set of specialized nodes, with GPUs dedicated to rendering and visualization of complex data;
			\item A set of storage devices.
		\end{itemize}
		The system should manage at least $128$ nodes with at least $16$ processor cores per node.
	
	\section{Glossary} 
	\label{sec:hardware_requirements_glossary}
		The glossary for hardware requirements found this chapter is presented in Table \ref{tab:hardware_requirements_glossary}. Information stored in this table refers to section \ref{sec:hardware_requirements_demands}. Each key found in the mentioned section is described and will be used in other section in order to be consistent with terminology.
