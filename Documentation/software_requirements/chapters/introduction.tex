\chapter{Introduction}
	For purposes of assignment University is in the process of acquiring a new supercomputer to support research activities. This task requires a proper hardware, safe accessibility of the user and smart scheduler for managing submitted jobs.
	
	In following chapters description is made about each of mentioned before requirements of the system. The culmination of process of acquiring a new supercomputer will be creating a simulation tool to model the behavior of the computing platform and to establish good accounting practices. 
	
	Chapter \ref{sec:hardware_requirements} presents requirements of University in terms of supercomputer's hardware. Next chapter is devoted to users and groups, which the users are connected. Chapter \ref{sec:scheduler_requirements} gives information about scheduling requirements and assumptions for simulator. Last chapter describes the parametrization of the simulator as well as output from each operation.
