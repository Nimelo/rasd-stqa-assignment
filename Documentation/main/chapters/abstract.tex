	This document describes structure of assignment. Each of chapters and sections briefly presents the content produced during analysis, design and implementation. The assignment is divided into six independent but connected in linear dependence way. 
	
	First document shows and explains all the requirements. From this document it is possible to determine use cases, from which designing of the architecture can starts. Having finished design document test planning should be next thing to do, which can be simultaneously done with programming. Finished code can be documented and tested giving also results of the simulation.
